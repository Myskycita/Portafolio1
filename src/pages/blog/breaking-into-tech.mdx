## Who am I?
I am a civil engineer graduated from National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), I've worked in the field for 7
years, specifically in construction and project management. I've always been interested in technology, but I never had
the opportunity to study it, so I decided to learn it on my own.

## So how it all started?
It was October 22, 2022 when I decided it was time to take a break from civil engineering due to multiple factors
and I knew it was time to try something else. I was very frightened about the taking this decision cause of 
what I read in that time about other people's journey and how some just ditched the journey and went back to their
