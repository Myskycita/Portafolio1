## So how did I got into this?

<br/>

The other day I was working on a project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) specifically the REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge. So I ran into this problem where I was trying to define all the types of the whole object that I received by from the http Response to validate it with Zod. 

<br/>

I was fetching the data from [the rest countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to print the response on the console of Chrome Dev Tools. So I questioned myself, how can I copy the response from the console? I tried to copy the response but it didn't work.

<br/>

So I started to search on the internet and I found this small tip to copy the response from the console. Next I found out that there were 2 options to copy the response from the console.

<br/>

## Option 1

<br/>

The first option is to right click on the response and click on the `Store as global variable` option. After that you can copy that temporary variable from the console writing inside de console `copy(temporaryVariable)`. Finally you can paste the response wherever you want.

## Option 2

<br/>

The second option is to right click on the response and click on the `Copy object` option.
